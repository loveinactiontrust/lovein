        <h1>THE BEGINNINGS OF LOVE IN ACTION CHILDREN’S HOME</h1>

        <b>Greetings to you of the day !!!</b>


        <p > “Love in Action” is the ultimate answered prayer to a young girl who grew up in an orphanage herself. Now
            married, loved, secure and settled with her own children she proceeded to give back to the community that
            saved her, she knew what was missing and she was determined to succeed in an endeavour of her own making.
             Charting a journey of her own, Carunia Anthony was determined to fulfil her purpose of starting a home for
            girls who were orphaned, physically and emotionally abused, those not wanted because they were “girls” and
            those who were left traumatised through no fault of their own and abandoned.</p>
        <p>
            Carunia Anthony along with her supportive and stalwart husband saved for the day they could carry out their
            dream of rescuing and housing girls, but with a difference. The difference was “love” , the vital ingredient
            to a complete home. They wanted the girls who needed this home to be loved, and feel the love that they were
            deprived of. Their purpose was “to walk the walk and not talk the talk” which spurred them into action and
            “Love in Action” came into being.
        </p>
        <p>  In 2004, the Children’s Home was finally established and registered with 10 children (only girls) and that
            number multiplied over the years. Altogether, 20 girls graduated from the Home after completing their
            10th and 12th standard exams. Many of them are placed in good jobs, some of them are married and have
            beautiful families of their own and are located in various parts of this country. Our commitment and vision
            is to give them basic education, teaching them the morals of life and establishing in them a vocation that
            they are able to handle.</p>
        <p>  At present, we have 10 children at the Home from the age group of 8 to 15 years. All of them attend school
            and are actively involved in various extra-curricular activities which shape and mould them to be good
            citizens. After the passing away of Mrs. Carunia Anthony in 2012, her daughter Nancy Anthony unmarried with
            Dad carried on the work , and eventually Nancy Anthony in the year 2021 she succumbed to covid and passed
            away, later on in the same year dad who was aged passed away too.  Eventually the only sibling who is my
            wife Rachel took up the challenge of continuing the work and having not sent the girls back to the slums.
            With some major setbacks my wife took up the responsibility.</p>
        <p>  We request you to kindly partner with us as we strive to do our best for the future of these
            precious underprivileged children in our society. Together, we can make a difference in their lives. Thank
            you for your kind consideration and generosity and for your contributions to a worthy cause. Our present
            urgent needs for funds to support the daily run of the orphanage, we have maids, cook and matron to be
            supported with your consent God bless each and every one of you.</p>
